    // system must always wait less than INT32_MAX microseconds in between time updates. If it does
    // wait INT32_MAX microseconds or more in between time updates, the subsequent subtraction of
    // firstTime - secondTime will almost certainly produce a result less than INT32_MAX,
    // meaning the system will believe the given container is not yet ready to send, when actually
    // it most certainly is. However, INT32_MAX microseconds is 35 minutes, 47 seconds, so if the
    // system has waited that long in between time updates then something's obviously very wrong.
