/**
 * Class for writing smaller chunks of bytes to a destination capable of transmitting
 * larger pieces of data. The destination is meant to be the output queue of a PDU transport channel
 * with a transmission timeout. Therefore, an instance of PduTransportBufferedWriter keeps track of
 * the timestamp of the creation of the payload of a frame.
 *
 * A PduTransportBufferedWriter will always allocate destination.max_size() bytes as a buffer and
 * then use this to give away chunks of data when allocating from it. Since the size of a PDU
 * varies, it makes sense to pack multiple PDUs into one Ethernet frame to minimize the protocol
 * overhead.
 *
 * When an allocation cannot guarantee destination.max_size() bytes, it flushes the current buffer
 * and allocates a new full sized chunk from the destination. A flush writes the data to the
 * destination. Hence, the current buffer is also flushed if the transmission timeout expires.
